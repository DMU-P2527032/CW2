    <p class="shaggyp"> <span id="NameofCeleb"></span> came in and she caught me red-handed
      Creeping with <span id="NameofSecondCeleb"></span> next door<br>
      Picture this, we were both butt-naked
      <span id="Verb"></span> on the bathroom floor<br>
      How could I forget that I had
      Given her an extra <span id="Object"></span><br>
      All this time <span id="NameofThirdCeleb"></span> was standing there
      She never took her eyes off me
