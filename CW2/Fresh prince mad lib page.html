<p class="freshprincep"> Now this is the story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called <span id="A made up town"></span><br>
In West <span id="A made up county"></span> born and raised<br><br>
On the playground is where I spent most of my days<br><br>
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool<br><br>
And all shooting some <span id="Activity"></span> outside of the school<br>
When a couple of guys, who we're up to no good<br><br>
Started making trouble in my neighbourhood<br><br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br><br>
And said, you're moving with your aunty and uncle in <span id="Another made up town"></span> </p>
